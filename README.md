# Smart Phone Application For Jordanian Civil Status and Passport Deparment 
## Jordan Univierist of Science and Technology

### Introduction 
Our application, GovApp, will provide efficient and faster delivery mechanism for citizen
services. It will also reduce the workload done by department personnel. Any Jordanian citizen
can sign up and use the application, he will be offered a variety of services that are provided
also by the Civil Status and Passport Services (CSPD). The user can apply for it from his home.
The application will be designed and implemented in a responsive, flexible and interactive
design; such that it requires least number of user actions/interaction to get the content
delivered and presented.

### Motivation
Unfortunately, unlike other departments in Jordan, the CSPD doesnâ€™t offer many services online for Jordanian citizens. According to the satisfaction of citizens on Egovernment services report (2018), out of 2,091,577 Jordanians and residents of Jordan who
used e-gov services only 893 used the CSPD online services. That is a small amount of
participation for such a huge department that issued almost a 5,002,078 document in 2017,
and the numbers are growing. Thus, creating an application for the CSPD to provide its
services is a necessity for Jordanians. It will save time and cost for both the CSPD and for the
service recipient. Furthermore, many developing and developed countries in the MENA
region have launched some websites and applications that are similar to our proposed
application and they were widely used by the citizens of those countries.

### Solution
Our proposed solution is to create a mobile application for the CSPD that can be accessed
via the internet at any time or anywhere. Having services available 24/7 will save time and
money and users can access all services via single portal. They can download and apply for
services via electronic forms. Also, they can upload documents that are required for some
specific services that are provided by the CSPD. By making the citizens interact with
government electronically, it will Improve the quality of services and reduce bureaucracy.
